# About this repo

This repo contains examples from the series on building MCP servers with Node.js

The series is available on [my blog](https://mikeborozdin.com/).

There you can find both blog posts and YouTube videos.

# Examples

- [Hello world & add](/examples/hello-world-and-add) - basic example of a very simple MCP server that has two tools - one for saying `Hello, world!` and the other one for adding two numebrs
- [Getting JSON data from SQLite](/examples/returning-json-from-sqlite/) - an MCP server that talks to a SQLite database and returns JSON
